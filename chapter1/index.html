    <p>Hi! My name is Kim -- an interior design enthusiast with a Master's degree who's recently discovered a passion for web development. My journey into coding started with a beginner web dev course (WEBD152), and I've been diving deeper ever since through continued learning. My goal is to combine my eye for design with new technical skills to build visually stunning and user-friendly websites â€” and eventually grow it into a solid side hustle.</p>

    <p>I also bring a strong foundation in digital tools like Adobe Creative Cloud, Canva, Revit, and AutoCAD. In design school, I loved using Revit and Photoshop to create immersive renderings, then pulling everything together in InDesign to tell a cohesive visual story through mood boards and presentations.</p>

    <p>Outside of tech and design, I&apos;m into staying active (hello, Peloton workouts!) and traveling with my husband. My favorite destinations so far include:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Amsterdam, Netherlands</strong> -- for its vibrant culture, bike-friendly streets, and stunning canals</li>
            <li><strong>Barcelona, Spain</strong> -- full of energy, architecture, and amazing food</li>
            <li><strong>Cinque Terre, Italy</strong> -- coastal views, charming villages, and incredible hiking trails like the Sentiero Azzurro (Blue Trail) and Via dell&apos;Amore that connect the towns with scenic cliffside paths.</li>
          </ul></p>
